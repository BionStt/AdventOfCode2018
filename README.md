# AdventOfCode2018
My solutions for the 2018 rendition of Advent of Code. https://adventofcode.com/

Since I first saw it back in 2015, I've wanted to participate in the Advent of Code. Each year I would either forget about it until it was too late or would be too busy with other things . This year I'm not going to let that happen. I was on the ball and started on the day of the even and so far so good. I'm hoping to complete each problem before Christmas is over but we'll see. Hopefully I'll be able to solve all of the problems.

I'm using C# with .NET Core 2.1 to solve the problems and xUnit to run the code.
